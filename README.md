# Simple-Neural-Network

This is my procedural implementation of a simple neural network to classify the MNIST image data set.

Please download the data from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Even with this naive implementation, we can get 95% and above accuracy. Of course more
complicated algorithms result in higher accuracy, but for a simplistic model this works reasonably well.

Code from this tutorial series comes from this book:
